GUI navigation
--------------

### Opening and closing panels

Clicking on the title of a panel, such as Notebooks and Search, opens, closes,
and in some cases, resizes it.

### Opening and closing all panels

When all RCloud panels are minimized in a column, a "+" sign will appear, as shown here:

Clicking the "+" sign will restore all panels in the column to their previous sizes. Now, a "-" sign will appear, shown below, which will minimize all open panels in a column.

### Changing panel width

To change the width of a panel, hover your mouse over the edge that touches the cells in the middle. When the mouse cursor changes into a double arrow, click and drag left and right to resize.
