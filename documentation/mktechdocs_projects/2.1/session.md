The session pane displays critical system information when available, such as session timeouts. The panel will automatically open when messages are available.

Click the <img style="margin: 0;float: none;display: inline;" src="img/session_close.png" /> icon to dismiss a session notification.

Note that Session panel output is limited to 10K in order to improve responsiveness when there is a large amount of output.
