Help
====

It's often difficult to remember arguments to functions and what they mean, so RCloud has an inline help feature. In a new prompt cell, type a question mark immediately followed by an R function name and then press `Enter/Return` to execute the cell:

    ?print

If help is available, RCloud will open the Help panel:

<a href="img/help.png"><img class="trunc" src="img/help.png" /></a>

Alternatively, you can enter a function name in the text box at the top of the panel and click the help icon <img style="margin: 0;float: none;display: inline;" src="img/help_button.png" />.
